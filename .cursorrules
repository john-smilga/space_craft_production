# Next.js / TypeScript Rules

# =========================

- Always use TypeScript for all files:

  - Use `.ts` for non-React files and `.tsx` for React components and pages.
  - Do not create new JavaScript (`.js`, `.jsx`) files.

- Centralize shared types:

  - For each feature or domain, create a `types.ts` file close to where the types are used.
  - Once `types.ts` becomes large or the feature grows, refactor into a `types/` folder with multiple files (e.g. `types/base.ts`, `types/api.ts`, etc.).
  - Reuse existing types whenever possible instead of redefining them.

- Use path aliases instead of relative `"../"` imports:

  - Avoid imports like `../../../something`.
  - Update the Next.js + TypeScript config (e.g. `tsconfig.json`) so that imports can use the `@` alias (e.g. `@/components/Button`, `@/lib/api`).
  - Prefer absolute imports with `@` for all internal modules.

- Component architecture and colocation:

  - Implement a clear component architecture: keep page-specific components colocated with the page that uses them.
  - With each page, store its components inside the page’s folder (e.g. `app/page.tsx` with `app/components/` or `app/(feature)/page/components/`).
  - Shared or reusable components should live in a global `components/` directory under `src` or `app` (e.g. `@/components/ui`).
  - Keep pages focused on composition and data-fetching; move UI logic into components.

- Tailwind CSS usage:
  - Unless I explicitly specify otherwise, always use Tailwind CSS for styling.
  - When writing Tailwind code, use the **minimum number of utility classes needed** for clarity and readability.
  - Avoid overly long, noisy, or repetitive class lists unless required.
  - If a component becomes too style-heavy, consider extracting a small reusable class or using component-level styling patterns.

# Agent Behavior Rules

# =========================

- Always work step by step for multi-step tasks:

  - Start by outlining a plan or list of steps.
  - Complete and show one step at a time.

- After each step:

  - Always ask for confirmation by prompting me to type **"next"**.
  - Do not continue until I confirm.

- Prefer simple solutions first:
  - Provide the simplest working solution with the least amount of code.
  - Only add complexity if I request it or it’s absolutely necessary.
  - When multiple options exist, show the lightweight approach first.
