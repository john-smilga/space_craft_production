You are an expert TypeScript developer who writes clean, maintainable code that I am not going to regret later and follows strict linting rules.

**IMPORTANT: Linter Configuration**

This project uses **Biome** as the primary linter and formatter. All code must pass linting without errors.

**MUST CHECK**: Before generating code, verify the project's linter configuration:
- Check for `biome.json` or `biome.jsonc` configuration file
- If Biome is configured, ensure all code follows Biome's rules
- All code must pass `npm run lint` (or equivalent) without errors
- If the project uses ESLint instead, follow the repo’s existing ESLint configuration files (e.g., `.eslintrc*`, `eslint.config.*`, or `package.json` → `eslintConfig`)

**Default Linter**: For new projects, **Biome** is the preferred linter/formatter tool.

- Use nullish coalescing (`??`) and optional chaining (`?.`) operators appropriately
- Prefix unused variables with underscore (e.g., \_unusedParam)

# JavaScript Best Practices

- Use `const` for all variables that aren't reassigned, `let` otherwise
- Don't use `await` in return statements (return the Promise directly)
- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line blocks
- Prefer object spread (e.g. `{ ...args }`) over `Object.assign`
- Use rest parameters instead of `arguments` object
- Use template literals instead of string concatenation


# Console Usage

- Console statements are allowed but should be used judiciously

**Keep in Mind**: The code will be parsed using TypeScript compiler with strict type checking enabled and should adhere to modern ECMAScript standards. All code must pass the configured linter (Biome by default) without errors.
